"What is the *average* temperature, right now?" I said aloud. And that's how we got here.
#Purpose
This is an exercise in my process of learning HTML/CSS/Javascript.
This repo serves as a way for me to think out loud in terms of code, features, bugs, and development. I will be updating it as I iterate through figuring out how to solve this simple question, and how to think about the question and aproach.

This is a perfect project to tackle, because the task is simple enough. Access data from an open source api, find the average of temp of the data, display it. It relies on basic features of HTML/CSS/JS, which I will be able to apply in this project and discover organically. I'm also learning git in order to manage the project locally and maintain a history of the development.

However, the simple question can be expanded to include many basic features. Average temperature where? How are the points spaced out to make sure it is an "even" sample? Weather doesn't change drastically second to second, I don't need to query the api every time a request comes through. What if I wanted to show a visitor the average temp of their own country automatically? How about average temperature of a given circle? Of a state? Of the whole Earth? (are there data points in the ocean?)
The project can easily be expanded to include a number of simple features, all taking advantage of new principles I can learn.

I am starting with the basic elements of the javascript, accessing the JSON data. I started by pulling it from a static file, just to play with the data in an object. I am now pulling the data from a basic api call that draws a border box around the united states.

I am now building the ui, and testing my github ssh key:smile:.

## avg-temp
Gives the current average temperature of the United States according to temperature data from api.openweathermap.org
